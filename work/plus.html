            <h3>What is PLUS?</h3>
            <p>
                PLUS (Personalized Learning Squared) is a CMU-based startup intent on doubling math learning for 10k+ middle schoolers by providing
                novel human-AI tutoring opportunities to under-served communities.
                <!-- PLUS is a part of the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/simon/index.html" target="_blank">Simon Initiative</a>. -->
            </p>
            <p>Currently, PLUS has helped 3k+ students through 500+ tutors, and has conducted 10k+ total hours of tutoring. </p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
                Based on user interviews and insights from tutors, lead tutors, and tutor supervisors, I transitioned an external tutor scheduling Google spreadsheet to
                a native PLUS scheduling table.

                <!-- complete with cancellation alerts, session filtering, and built-in tutor attendance actions.  -->

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    The previous Google spreadsheet was a static solution to the dynamic problem of scheduling.
                    It provided <b>1 universal, outdated, and passive view to 3 user groups with differing needs.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The native scheduling table I designed still carries the necessary static session info, 
                    but contains <b>3 distinct user views, dyanmic alerts, and action-oriented buttons.</b>  
                </p>

            <h3>General Process</h3>
            <div class="text-only">
                <p>
                    While we had a clear understanding of what tutor supervisors needed from a scheduling table
                    from past user research, there was uncertainty in what tutors/lead tutors needed out of the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, I conducted user research in the form of 20-min interviews to identify tutor and lead tutor scheduling JTBD's. 
                    Specifically, I sought to evaluate the scheduling Google spreadsheet's performance and understand how tutors/lead tutors used the spreadsheet. 
                </p>

            <h3>User Interview: Directed Storytelling</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    The first part of the user interviews involved using directed storytelling -- a "show not tell" approach -- to uncover the main painpoints of the spreadsheet.
                    <!-- It's much easier for people to describe their everyday workflows rather than identify specific issues they have with a product.  -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    This way, I'm able to determine accurate painpoints users have with the spreadsheet, while placing less strain on the participant. 
                </p>

            <h3>User Interview: Interactive Activity</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    The interactive activity part of the interviews gave participants the opportunity to rename, add, reorder, and delete columns on the scheduling spreadsheet.
                    I asked participants to talk through the changes they're making and <i>why</i> they made certain changes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this activity, participants are able to implicitly express their pain points with the spreadsheet that they might've not been able to detail in the directed storytelling section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once finished with interviews, I compiled all the data into digestible insights shown below.
                    Based on the insights, I created distinct HMW questions that outlined this product's problem space.

                    While cancellations are detailed via Slack/Gmail, sometimes tutors won't see these external messages.
                    They will — however — check the spreadsheet. But since cancellations aren't updated on the spreadsheet,
                    miscommunication can occur.

                <p>
                    When the "View Tutors"/"Take Attendance" button is clicked, a pop-up window appears where lead tutors can check off tutors for that specific session and leave any notes.

                    Tutors, lead tutors, and admin all have different needs and restrictions.
                    Since we record the user type of each PLUS account, each user automatically views the interface for their user group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Differences between the interfaces include:

                </p>
                <p>
                    This way, tutors don't have to manually find their names in all the sessions, and they still have the option to view all sessions.

                <p>
                    Admin can create these alerts from their interface, and once confirmed, the alerts propagate as dismissble banners to the tutors signed-up for the cancelled sessions.
                    The column rows corresponding to cancelled sessions will now be in "disabled" mode.

                <p>

            <p>
                Before this project, I'd never worked with multiple distinct user groups. 
                I had to keep in mind sometimes conflicting JTBDs, while making sure the design was still consistent across each group.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also learned that <b>design lives within the context of development</b>.
                Shiv (head of product) noted the difficulties of coding complex pagination and different interfaces for one product.
                I hadn't considered that some features are easy to implement design-wise, but not so much dev-wise. 
                Moving forward I'll make sure my designs <b> take into account developer time and feasibility.</b> 
            </p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>
                In August 2024, I shipped my design off to the PLUS developers.
                Tutors and tutor supervisors are incredibly excited for the new schedule to be fully published!
